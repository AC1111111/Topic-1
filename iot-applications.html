      <b>Activity 1:</b>
      This activity consisted of me and my group filling in a mind map about IoT to the best of our capabilities.
      This mind map included the following questions:
      <ul>
        <li>What is an IoT application?</li>
        <li>What are some Examples?</li>
        <li>What are the main Features needed?</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Activity 2:</b>
      This activity consisted of me and my group filling in a mind map about Smart Buildings to the best of our capabilities.
      This mind map included the following questions:
